Summary: This was a project I made from Summer 2020 to Winter 2020. The goal was to create a Discord Bot capable of managing all Dungeon-Master related tasks in regards to a tabletop game. In this scenario, it was for a game I was designing. The project remains unfinished; and while the DiscordBot does indeed function, the code needs to be refactored heavily.
